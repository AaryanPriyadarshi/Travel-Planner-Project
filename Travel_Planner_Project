        "- Flight Selection Tool to find the most cost-effective flights  \n",
        "- Hotel Recommendation Tool to suggest budget-friendly yet quality accommodation  \n",
        "- Tourist Places Tool to identify highly rated attractions  \n",
        "- Weather Tool using Open-Meteo API for live environmental insights  \n",
        "- Budget Estimation Tool for financial planning  \n",
        "\n",
        "All components are coordinated using a central **Main Travel Agent Function**, which performs data validation, executes decision logic, generates a day-wise travel itinerary, and compiles a complete travel plan.\n",
